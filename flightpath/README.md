The prog2.pl assignment was completed in Prolog. The database and assignment code is generally supposed to be seperate, but for this assignment
we had to have it together. The code only works with the database provided or one that has similar characteristics. There are certain features that
are lacking in this code as this was my first exposure to programming in Prolog and as such, seeing a logic programming language in general.

To run the code:

1) Copy the code into a file using the Linux kernel.
2) Run using the swipl compiler for Prolog or install it here https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html.
   After installing, input the following command swipl filename.pl with the filename replaced with the filename of the file that you copied the
   contents into.
3) Now you can test the code by providing the following query (?- fly(?,?).)
   Replace the two ?'s with two respective airports (e.g. lax, nyc, atl) with the provided database or custom database.
   Note: Make sure to close the fly(?,?) query with a "." as this is what Prolog is attempting to prove.
